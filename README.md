# machine-learning
## Task

1. Create a new repo called "machine-learning" and include a read-me file which will give more information about the repo.
2. Using the data set provided, carry out an exploratory and explanatory analysis using a jupyter notebook
3. Push this notebook to the repo ("machine-learning")  and include more information on the read-me of 
   the analysis task to give more context on the dataset and the whole analysis.
4. The link to the repo should be included in the document that will be provided.




## Introduction
This repository contains the code and data used to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on hotel booking demand.

The data used in this analysis is from Hotel Booking Demand dataset available on Kaggle. This dataset contains information on hotel bookings, including the number of adults and children, the booking channel, the type of room booked, and whether the booking was canceled or not.

The aim of this EDA is to explore the dataset, gain insights, and provide a summary of the findings. The analysis is performed in Python using Jupyter Notebooks.

Data Description
The dataset used in this analysis contains two separate hotel datasets: one for a city hotel and one for a resort hotel. The data was originally collected by Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida, and Luis Nunes of the Polytechnic Institute of Porto, Portugal.


## Exploratory Data Analysis for Hotel Booking 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Hotel Booking refers to the process of examining and analyzing a dataset of hotel booking information to gain insights, identify patterns, and understand the underlying relationships among the different variables. The aim of this analysis is to explore the data and provide a summary of the findings. 

The steps for EDA in this repository is as follows:
Step 1 : Importing libraries that are important for visualizing and exploring the dataset
Step 2 : Reading or Importing the dataset
Step 3 : Describing the data to understand the general out look of the data
Step 4 : Finding and fixing problems with missing values
Step 5 : Exploring and visualizing the data

In step three the following questions were explored and answered during the EDA;

1 Which hotels are booked more
2 Which months has the most bookings
3 Which months has the most cancelled bookings
4 Which hotel has the most cancelled bookings
5 Which hotel has the most cancelled bookings
6 Which country has the most bookings
7 Which agents have the most hotel bookings
and soo on ...
